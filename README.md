# medicinal-plant-classifier
This repository contains a Medicinal Plant Classification project built with Streamlit and a pre-trained ResNet model using TensorFlow. The goal is to classify medicinal plants from a dataset of 1058 images across 40 classes. This project could be especially useful for educational purposes, botanical research, and applications in herbal medicine.
